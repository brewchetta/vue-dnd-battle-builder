# D&D Battle Builder

Possibly to be known as the Battle Screen at some point. I dunno, I'm just spitballing.

A user can:

- See all battles
- Create battles
- Create enemies
- Customize enemies
- Start battles with enemy health / initiative

Stretches:

- Can persist battles across sessions
- Has a personalized battles page showing that user's battles
- GraphQL (is this necessary for what I'm doing?)

Current Phase:

- persisting monsters and retrieving them
- adding abilities to monsters
