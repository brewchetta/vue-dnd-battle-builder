# D&D Battle Builder

Possibly to be known as the Battle Screen at some point. I dunno, I'm just spitballing.

If you're curious about this website, it's an interface for creating monster encounters in D&D similar to what's available on the D&D Beyond website. The main difference is that this site will be logged entirely by users and include more useful tools for encounters such as an initiative tracker, dice roller, and hit point tracker to make a DM's life easier.

A user can:

- See all battles
- Create battles
- Create enemies
- Customize enemies
- Start battles with enemy health / initiative

Stretches:

- Can persist battles across sessions
- Has a personalized battles page showing that user's battles
- GraphQL (is this necessary for what I'm doing?)

Current Phase:

- persisting monsters and retrieving them
- adding abilities to monsters
- refactoring component hierarchy
